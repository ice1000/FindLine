# FindLine

A JVM App used to distinguish lines in a png file.<br/>
Core is written in Kotlin, and boxed with Groovy. You can control the behavior simply by the DSL based on Groovy.<br/>
GUI is based on Swing.<br/>
Working in progress.

# Build

Use IntelliJ IDEA with Kotlin and Groovy Plugin (which are very easy to install), clone and open, that is all.

# About

I'm trying my best to decrease the number of lines of codes.<br/>
Each line of Kotlin code contains a complex function, but it's still easy to read.
